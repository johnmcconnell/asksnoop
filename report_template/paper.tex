\section{Introduction}

You don't have to follow these section names if you don't want to, but you
should definitely include an introduction and conclusion.

\section{Related Work}

What similar things are already out there? You can cite things like
this~\cite{manning-ir-book} and this~\cite{zhai-smoothing}. I got the second
reference bibtex from \url{http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=984322}. I just
simplified the bibtex reference names to ``manning-ir-book'' and
``zhai-smoothing''. Also, did you notice that URL and citations were clickable?

\section{Experiments}

Did you perform any experiments?

\section{Discussion}

Are there any interesting questions or findings that should be discussed?

\section{Conclusion}

Here's why our project is great, and this is what we told you in the paper.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The authors would like to thank people for things. You can delete this section
if you want.

\section{Division of Labor (for grading)}

This section is only necessary for the class project, not for the literature
survey. Sarah did all the work. Bob did nothing.
